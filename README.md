Moodboard - A Smart Movie Discovery App
Welcome to Moodboard! This is an ongoing project to build a smart movie discovery engine powered by sentiment analysis. The core idea is to go beyond simple genre recommendations and connect users with films that match their unique taste, visualized through a personal "moodboard."

The application features a full-stack user authentication system using JWTs, deep integration with the TMDB API for real-time movie data, and a review system where user input is analyzed for its emotional tone. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, while the frontend is a dynamic single-page application using React and DaisyUI.

Status: Development is active in the master branch.
